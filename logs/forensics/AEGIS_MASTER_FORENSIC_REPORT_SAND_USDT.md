## ❓ The Three Questions

> These three questions answer what matters for P&L.
> Every finding cites the exact file and line where the problem lives.

### Q1 — Why Is Precision Lower Than It Should Be?

> Measured precision is 30.5% — estimated 7.0pp below achievable ceiling of ~37.5%. Primary contributors: Barrier skew suppresses BUY labels (−2.2pp), HOLD over-representation in labels (−2.4pp)

#### Precision Waterfall

```
Measured holdout precision :  30.5%

  [✅ FIXED       ]  −2.2pp prec    Barrier skew suppresses BUY labels
  [✅ FIXED       ]  −2.4pp prec    HOLD over-representation in labels
  [✅ FIXED       ]  −8.0pp recall  BUY side completely disabled (min_fires deadlock)
  [🔴 ACTIVE      ]  −2.0pp prec    Brier score above target
  [🔴 ACTIVE      ]  −0.4pp prec    Gate blocking signals that would have won

Achievable precision       :  ~37.5%  (+7.0pp precision)
Recall deficit (BUY side)  :  −11.2pp  (signals not firing)
```

### Q2 — Where Exactly Is Each Problem?

| Issue | File | Lines | Symbol | −Prec | −Recall |
|-------|------|-------|--------|-------|---------|
| Brier score above target | `scripts/retrain_model.py` | 1909-1916 | `_hold_w = clip(_n_dir×0.5 / _n_hold` | 2.0pp | 0.0pp |
| Gate blocking signals that would have won | `scripts/retrain_model.py` | 1909-1916 | `_hold_w = clip(_n_dir×0.5 / _n_hold` | 0.4pp | 0.0pp |

**1. Brier score above target**
> 📍 `scripts/retrain_model.py:1909-1916` — `_hold_w = clip(_n_dir×0.5 / _n_hold, 0.10, 0.60)`
> HOLD bars always have meta_y=0 (primary proposes BUY/SELL but true label=HOLD). With HOLD=66%, 60% of meta training targets are al…

**2. Gate blocking signals that would have won**
> 📍 `scripts/retrain_model.py:1909-1916` — `_hold_w = clip(_n_dir×0.5 / _n_hold, 0.10, 0.60)`
> HOLD bars always have meta_y=0 (primary proposes BUY/SELL but true label=HOLD). With HOLD=66%, 60% of meta training targets are al…

### Q3 — What Is The Best Fix Right Now?

✅ **3 issues already applied** in the codebase (expected gain: +7.9pp once retrained).

**Highest-ROI remaining fix: Brier score above target** (expected +2.0pp):
> 📍 `scripts/retrain_model.py:1909-1916`
> Lower _hold_w floor from 0.10 to 0.05 OR exclude HOLD bars from meta training.

#### BUY Side Gate Trace

🔴 **BUY DISABLED — root cause at Gate: 2. pick_threshold_by_side(BUY) can qualify**

✅ **1. Primary model generates BUY labels**
   - `scripts/retrain_model.py:849-928 (create_triple_barrier_labels)`
   - Check: `BUY label count > 0 in training data`
   - Value: 88 BUY proposals / 440 total directional
   - PASS — primary fires BUY on some bars.

❌ **2. pick_threshold_by_side(BUY) can qualify**
   - `scripts/retrain_model.py:1363-1397`
   - Check: `MAX_SIDE_COVERAGE=0.35×pool(70)=24 ≥ min_fires=35`
   - Value: 24 max fires vs 35 required
   - FAIL (FIXED) — 24 < 35. Deadlock: every quantile rejected before precision is checked. Fix: MAX_SIDE_COVERAGE→0.35 + adaptive effective_min_fires.

❌ **3. hit_buy=True (OOF precision clears target)**
   - `scripts/retrain_model.py:1996-2004`
   - Check: `pick_threshold_by_side(side=2).hit_target → stored as tradeable_buy`
   - Value: tradeable_buy in sidecar = False
   - FAIL — hit_buy=False because Gate 2 deadlock blocked threshold qualification.

❌ **4. buy_fire mask fires BUY holdout signals**
   - `scripts/retrain_model.py:2169-2174`
   - Check: `buy_fire = (meta_prob_h ≥ max(thr_buy, rank_thr)) & (prop_h==2)`
   - Value: buy_h_n = 0 holdout BUY signals fired
   - FAIL — 0 BUY holdout trades. Even when hit_buy=True, SELL-biased rank gate may crowd out BUY signals. File: retrain_model.py:2097-2108.

❌ **5. tradeable_buy_holdout = True**
   - `scripts/retrain_model.py:2288-2292`
   - Check: `hit_buy AND buy_h_n > 0 AND buy_h_prec ≥ 0.50`
   - Value: buy_h_n=0, buy_win_rate=0.0%
   - FAIL — `buy_h_n > 0` is a hard requirement. If Gate 4 fails (zero holdout BUY fires), this is permanently False.

#### Meta Gate Audit

🔴 **Gate status: HURTING**  (lift: -23.3pp)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Gated-in precision | 30.5% |
| Blocked signals win rate | 53.8% |
| Precision lift from gate | -23.3pp |
| OOF → Holdout gap | +45.0pp |
| thr_buy / thr_sell | 46.573 / 46.573 |
| Blocked signals | 0 (218 would-win / 187 would-lose) |

> ⚠ Gate is DESTROYING 23.3pp of precision. Blocked signals (53.8%) would have beaten gated (30.5%). Meta model is anti-selective. | OOF overfit warning: dev_prec (75.6%) exceeds holdout (30.5%) by 45.0pp.

## Section 15 — Executive Summary

**Symbol:** SAND/USDT  |  **Audit:** 2026-06-07 16:39  |  **Confidence Level:** MEDIUM — based on 47 holdout signals; widen to 200+ for HIGH

**Current:** Precision=30.5%  Sharpe=12.14
**Expected after fixes:** Precision≈36.3%  (+5.8pp)

### Top 5 Problems

1. 🔴 **BUY Side Fully Disabled** — Score: 88/100
   > buy_n=0 in holdout. Model fires SELL-only. Halves available signal universe.

2. 🟡 **Severe Class Imbalance (HOLD dominates)** — Score: 65/100
   > HOLD=65.7% of labels. Meta model sees 60% zero-labels → calibration distorted.

3. 🟡 **HMM Regime Collapse** — Score: 62/100
   > Max state concentration=100.0%. HMM assigning most bars to one state.


### Top 5 Fixes

1. **BUY Side Fully Disabled**
   → Raise MAX_SIDE_COVERAGE→0.35, adaptive effective_min_fires. Already applied.

2. **Severe Class Imbalance (HOLD dominates)**
   → base_vol_threshold→0.72, symmetric BARRIER skews. Already applied.

3. **HMM Regime Collapse**
   → Re-train HMM (random_state=42 already set). Verify 9 regime features are non-degenerate.
